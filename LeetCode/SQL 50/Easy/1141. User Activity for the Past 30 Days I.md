# User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of distinct users who logged in each day for the past 30 days from the `Activity` table. The query should return the activity date and the count of active users on that day.

The `Activity` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| user_id       | int     |
| activity_date | date    |

```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM 
    Activity
WHERE 
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURDATE()
GROUP BY
    activity_date
ORDER BY 
    activity_date;
```

## Explanation
1. **COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)**: Counts the number of distinct users who were active on each specific date.
2. **WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURDATE()**: Filters the results to include only the activity from the past 30 days up to the current date.
3. **GROUP BY activity_date**: Groups the results by `activity_date` to calculate the distinct user count for each day.
4. **ORDER BY activity_date**: Orders the results chronologically by activity date.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Activity` table. The complexity arises from the filtering, grouping, and counting operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique activity dates.

## Key Concepts
- SQL GROUP BY clause
- COUNT with DISTINCT to find unique active users
- Filtering with date functions
- Ordering results with ORDER BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Activity` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
