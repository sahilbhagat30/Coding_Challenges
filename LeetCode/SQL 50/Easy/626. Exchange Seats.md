# Exchange Seats

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Seat` containing seat numbers and student names, write a SQL query to swap the seat assignments of students in adjacent seats. If the number of students is odd, the last student's seat should remain unchanged. The result should contain the seat ID and the adjusted student name for each seat.

## Table Structure
**Seat** table:
| Column Name | Type    | Description                              |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| id          | int     | Unique identifier for each seat          |
| student     | varchar | Name of the student assigned to the seat |

- `id`: Represents the unique seat number (in ascending order).
- `student`: Represents the name of the student currently assigned to that seat.

## Example Input

**Seat** table:
| id  | student |
| --- | ------- |
| 1   | A       |
| 2   | B       |
| 3   | C       |
| 4   | D       |
| 5   | E       |

### Explanation of Input Data
- Each row represents a student assigned to a seat in sequential order by `id`.

## Expected Output

| id  | student |
| --- | ------- |
| 1   | B       |
| 2   | A       |
| 3   | D       |
| 4   | C       |
| 5   | E       |

### Explanation of Output
- Seat 1 and Seat 2 are swapped, resulting in "B" and "A".
- Seat 3 and Seat 4 are swapped, resulting in "D" and "C".
- Seat 5 has no adjacent seat to swap with, so it remains "E".

```sql
SELECT
    ID,CASE
    WHEN ID%2=0 THEN LAG(STUDENT)OVER(ORDER BY ID)
                ELSE IFNULL(LEAD(STUDENT)OVER(ORDER BY ID), STUDENT) END AS student
FROM 
    SEAT
```

## Solution Outline

1. **Use Conditional Logic to Swap Students**:
   - For even-numbered seats (`id % 2 = 0`), retrieve the student in the previous seat (using `LAG`).
   - For odd-numbered seats (`id % 2 = 1`), retrieve the student in the next seat (using `LEAD`). If the next seat does not exist (in the case of an odd number of rows), use the current student’s name.

2. **Window Functions for Swapping**:
   - `LAG(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)` retrieves the student from the previous seat, helping to swap students for even-numbered seats.
   - `LEAD(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)` retrieves the student from the next seat, allowing swaps for odd-numbered seats.
   - `IFNULL` ensures that if there is no next seat (e.g., the last student in an odd-numbered list), the current student is retained.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The query returns `id` and the swapped `student` name, maintaining the seat order.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Seat` table. The window functions `LAG` and `LEAD` operate efficiently across ordered data.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the result set contains the same number of rows as the `Seat` table.

## Key Concepts
- **Conditional Logic in SQL**: Using `CASE` to handle swapping based on even or odd `id`.
- **Window Functions**: Utilizing `LAG` and `LEAD` for adjacent row retrieval to perform swaps.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensuring the last student in an odd list of seats remains unchanged using `IFNULL`.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes that seats are ordered by `id` and that each seat has a unique `id`.
- It’s important to use `ORDER BY id` in window functions to maintain the correct sequence.
