# 1378. Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to replace the employee ID with the unique identifier for each employee. You need to join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeUNI` table based on the employee ID.

The `Employees` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

The `EmployeeUNI` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| unique_id   | varchar |

- The `id` column in the `Employees` table corresponds to the `id` column in the `EmployeeUNI` table.
- You need to return the `unique_id` from the `EmployeeUNI` table and the `name` from the `Employees` table.

## Example Input
**Employees Table:**

| id | name    |
|----|---------|
| 1  | John    |
| 2  | Jane    |
| 3  | Alice   |

**EmployeeUNI Table:**

| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | U123      |
| 2  | U456      |
| 3  | U789      |

## Example Output
| unique_id | name  |
|-----------|-------|
| U123      | John  |
| U456      | Jane  |
| U789      | Alice |

```sql
SELECT
    EUI.unique_id,
    E.name
FROM
    Employees E
LEFT JOIN 
    EmployeeUNI EUI ON EUI.id = E.id
```

## Explanation
- The query should return the `unique_id` for each employee based on their `id` from the `EmployeeUNI` table, along with their name from the `Employees` table.

## Key Concepts
- SQL JOIN operations
- Handling NULL values with LEFT JOIN
- Basic SELECT statements

## Difficulty
