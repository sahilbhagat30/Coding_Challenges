# List the Products Ordered in a Period

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Orders` that contains information about customer orders and their order dates, write a SQL query to retrieve the product names ordered between specific dates, `2020-02-01` and `2020-02-29` (inclusive). The output should display the product names in alphabetical order without duplicates.

## Table Structure
**Orders** table:
| Column Name | Type    | Description                               |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| order_id    | int     | Unique identifier for each order          |
| order_date  | date    | The date the order was placed             |
| product_name| varchar | The name of the product ordered           |

- `order_id`: Represents the unique ID of each order.
- `order_date`: Represents the date when the order was placed.
- `product_name`: Represents the name of the product ordered on that date.

## Example Input

**Orders** table:
| order_id | order_date | product_name |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1        | 2020-02-10 | "Laptop"     |
| 2        | 2020-02-15 | "Phone"      |
| 3        | 2020-02-15 | "Laptop"     |
| 4        | 2020-03-01 | "Tablet"     |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The date range for the query is from `2020-02-01` to `2020-02-29`.
- During this period, the products ordered were "Laptop" and "Phone".

## Expected Output

| product_name |
|--------------|
| "Laptop"     |
| "Phone"      |

### Explanation of Output
- Only products ordered within the specified date range (`2020-02-01` to `2020-02-29`) are included in the result.
- The result includes distinct product names, listed in alphabetical order.

```sql
SELECT 
  P.product_name, 
  Sum(O.unit) unit 
FROM 
  Orders O 
  Join Products P on P.product_id = O.product_id 
WHERE 
  EXTRACT(
    MONTH 
    FROM 
      order_date
  ) = '02' 
  AND EXTRACT(
    YEAR 
    FROM 
      order_date
  ) = '2020' 
Group BY 
  P.product_name 
HAVING 
  Sum(O.unit) >= 100
```

## Solution Outline

1. **Filter by Date Range**:
   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `order_date` falls between `2020-02-01` and `2020-02-29`.

2. **Select Distinct Product Names**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` on `product_name` to avoid duplicates.

3. **Order by Product Name**:
   - Use `ORDER BY product_name` to ensure the results are displayed in alphabetical order.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the `Orders` table. Filtering by date and ordering add computational overhead.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique products ordered within the date range.

## Key Concepts
- **Filtering by Date Range**: Using `BETWEEN` or equivalent conditions to restrict results to a specified period.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Using `DISTINCT` to ensure each product appears only once in the output.
- **Alphabetical Ordering**: Ordering product names alphabetically for consistent presentation.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes that the date range is fixed and covers all orders within February 2020.
- The query is designed to return a unique and ordered list of product names based on the specified date range.
