# Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the percentage of users who attended each contest. The query should return the contest ID and the percentage of users who attended, rounded to two decimal places. The result should be sorted in descending order by percentage and, in case of ties, by contest ID in ascending order.

The `Users` and `Register` tables have the following structures:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| user_id       | int     |

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| contest_id    | int     |
| user_id       | int     |

```sql
SELECT
    R.CONTEST_ID,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(R.USER_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT USER_ID) FROM USERS), 2) AS percentage
FROM
    USERS U
JOIN
    REGISTER R
    ON R.USER_ID = U.USER_ID
GROUP BY 
    R.CONTEST_ID
ORDER BY
    percentage DESC, R.CONTEST_ID;
```

## Explanation
1. **JOIN REGISTER R ON R.USER_ID = U.USER_ID**: Joins the `Users` and `Register` tables based on user ID to link each user with their corresponding contest registration.
2. **ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(R.USER_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT USER_ID) FROM USERS), 2)**: Calculates the percentage of users who attended each contest, rounding it to two decimal places.
3. **GROUP BY R.CONTEST_ID**: Groups the results by contest ID to calculate the percentage for each contest.
4. **ORDER BY percentage DESC, R.CONTEST_ID**: Sorts the results by percentage in descending order, and by contest ID in ascending order in case of ties.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the `Users` table and m is the number of rows in the `Register` table. The complexity arises from the join and grouping operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique contests.

## Key Concepts
- SQL JOIN statement
- Calculating percentages
- Grouping results with GROUP BY clause
- Sorting results with ORDER BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Users` and `Register` tables are populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
