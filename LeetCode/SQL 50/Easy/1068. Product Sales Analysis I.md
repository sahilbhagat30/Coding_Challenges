# Product Sales Analysis I

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to retrieve the product name, year, and price of each product sold. You need to join the `PRODUCT` table with the `SALES` table based on the product ID.

The `PRODUCT` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| PRODUCT_ID    | int     |
| PRODUCT_NAME  | varchar |

The `SALES` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| PRODUCT_ID    | int     |
| YEAR          | int     |
| PRICE         | decimal |

- The `PRODUCT_ID` column in the `PRODUCT` table corresponds to the `PRODUCT_ID` column in the `SALES` table.
- You need to return the `PRODUCT_NAME`, `YEAR`, and `PRICE` for each product sold.

## Example Input
**PRODUCT Table:**

| PRODUCT_ID | PRODUCT_NAME |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Product A    |
| 2          | Product B    |
| 3          | Product C    |

**SALES Table:**

| PRODUCT_ID | YEAR | PRICE |
|------------|------|-------|
| 1          | 2020 | 10.00 |
| 1          | 2021 | 12.00 |
| 2          | 2020 | 15.00 |
| 3          | 2021 | 20.00 |

## Example Output
| PRODUCT_NAME | YEAR | PRICE |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Product A    | 2020 | 10.00 |
| Product A    | 2021 | 12.00 |
| Product B    | 2020 | 15.00 |
| Product C    | 2021 | 20.00 |

```sql
SELECT
    P.PRODUCT_NAME,
    S.YEAR,
    S.PRICE
FROM
    PRODUCT P
JOIN
    SALES S ON S.PRODUCT_ID = P.PRODUCT_ID
```

## Explanation
- The query should return the product name, year, and price for each product sold, based on the data from the `PRODUCT` and `SALES` tables.
