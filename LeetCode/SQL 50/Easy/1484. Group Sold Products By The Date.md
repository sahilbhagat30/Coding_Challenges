# Group Sold Products by the Date

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Activities` that records products sold on specific dates, write a SQL query to group the products sold by each date. For each date, display the number of distinct products sold and a list of the distinct product names in alphabetical order.

## Table Structure
**Activities** table:
| Column Name | Type    | Description                           |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| sell_date   | date    | The date the product was sold        |
| product     | varchar | The name of the product sold         |

- `sell_date`: The date the product was sold.
- `product`: The name of the product sold on that date.

## Example Input

**Activities** table:
| sell_date | product    |
|-----------|------------|
| 2022-01-01 | "Book"    |
| 2022-01-01 | "Pen"     |
| 2022-01-01 | "Book"    |
| 2022-01-02 | "Pencil"  |
| 2022-01-02 | "Book"    |

### Explanation of Input Data
- On `2022-01-01`, two distinct products were sold: "Book" and "Pen".
- On `2022-01-02`, two distinct products were sold: "Book" and "Pencil".

## Expected Output

| sell_date  | num_sold | products        |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 2022-01-01 | 2        | "Book,Pen"      |
| 2022-01-02 | 2        | "Book,Pencil"   |

### Explanation of Output
- For each date, `num_sold` indicates the number of distinct products sold on that date.
- `products` is a list of distinct product names sold on that date, sorted alphabetically.

```sql
select 
  sell_date, 
  count(distinct product) as num_sold, 
  GROUP_CONCAT(
    distinct product 
    order by 
      product
  ) as products 
from 
  Activities 
group by 
  sell_date 
order by 
  sell_date;
```

## Solution Outline

1. **Count Distinct Products**:
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` to get the number of unique products sold on each date.

2. **Group and Concatenate Product Names**:
   - Use `GROUP_CONCAT` (or equivalent string aggregation function) to create a comma-separated list of distinct product names, ordered alphabetically.

3. **Group and Sort by Date**:
   - Group the results by `sell_date` and order them by `sell_date` in ascending order to ensure each date's sales are displayed sequentially.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the `Activities` table. The `GROUP BY` and sorting add computational overhead.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the output may contain one row per unique date.

## Key Concepts
- **Aggregation**: Counting distinct products sold per date using `COUNT(DISTINCT product)`.
- **String Aggregation**: Using `GROUP_CONCAT` to combine product names in alphabetical order.
- **Sorting**: Sorting products alphabetically within the `GROUP_CONCAT` function and grouping by date.

## Additional Notes
- This solution uses MySQLâ€™s `GROUP_CONCAT` function. Other databases may require different syntax (e.g., `STRING_AGG` in PostgreSQL).
- Ensure that `GROUP_CONCAT` is used with `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates and an `ORDER BY` clause to ensure alphabetical sorting.
