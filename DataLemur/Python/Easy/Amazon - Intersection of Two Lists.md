# Intersection of Two Lists

## Problem Statement
Write a function to find the intersection of two lists. The intersection is defined as the common elements that appear in both lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.

## Example
- **Input**: 
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `b = [0, 1, 3, 7]`
- **Output**: 
  - `[1, 3]` (because 1 and 3 are present in both lists)

## Function Definition
```py
def intersection(a, b):
    result = []
    
    if len(a) < len(b):
        shorter_list = a
        set_x = set(b)
    else:
        shorter_list = b
        set_x = set(a)

    for item in shorter_list:
        if item in set_x:
            result.append(item)
    
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    B = [0, 1, 3, 7]  # Example lists
    result = intersection(A, B)
    print(f"The intersection of A and B is: {result}")   
```

## Explanation
1. **Determine Shorter List**: The function checks the lengths of both lists to determine which one is shorter. This helps minimize the number of iterations.
2. **Use of Set for Efficient Lookups**: The longer list is converted into a set, allowing for O(1) average time complexity for membership checking.
3. **Iterate Through Shorter List**: The function iterates through the shorter list and checks if each element is present in the set created from the longer list. If it is, the element is added to the result list.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the list of common elements.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N is the length of the shorter list and M is the length of the longer list. The set lookup is O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M) for storing the elements of the longer list in a set.

## Key Concepts
- Set operations for efficient lookups
- Iteration through lists
- Handling of different list lengths

## Additional Notes
- This solution efficiently handles cases where the lists have different lengths.
- Ensure that the input lists can contain duplicate elements if you want to maintain the count of intersections.

## Difficulty
Easy
