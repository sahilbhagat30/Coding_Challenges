# The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of direct reports for each employee. The query should return the employee ID and the count of employees reporting to that employee.

The `Employees` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| reports_to    | int     |

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    COUNT(reports_to) AS reports_count
FROM 
    Employees
GROUP BY 
    employee_id;
```

## Explanation
1. **GROUP BY employee_id**: Groups the employees by their ID to calculate the count of direct reports for each employee.
2. **COUNT(reports_to)**: Counts the number of employees that report to each employee.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employees` table. The complexity arises from the grouping and counting operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique employee IDs.

## Key Concepts
- GROUP BY clause
- Counting relationships with COUNT()

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Employees` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
