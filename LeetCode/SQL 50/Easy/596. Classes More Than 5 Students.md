# Classes More Than 5 Students

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the classes that have more than 5 students enrolled. The query should return the class name.

The `Courses` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| student       | varchar |
| class         | varchar |

```sql
SELECT 
    class
FROM 
    Courses
GROUP BY 
    class
HAVING COUNT(student) > 4;
```

## Explanation
1. **GROUP BY class**: Groups the records by `class` to calculate the number of students in each class.
2. **HAVING COUNT(student) > 4**: Filters the groups to include only those classes that have more than 4 students.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Courses` table. The complexity arises from the grouping and filtering operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of classes meeting the condition.

## Key Concepts
- SQL GROUP BY clause
- Filtering groups with HAVING clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Courses` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.

## Difficulty
Easy
