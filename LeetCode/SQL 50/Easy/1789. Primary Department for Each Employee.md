# Primary Department for Each Employee

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the primary department for each employee. If an employee belongs to only one department, that department is their primary department. If an employee belongs to multiple departments, the department with the `primary_flag` set to 'Y' is their primary department. The query should return the employee ID and the department ID.

The `Employee` table has the following structure:

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| department_id    | int     |
| primary_flag     | char    |

## User's Query
The following query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify employees with only one department or their primary department:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS unique_department_id
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
)
SELECT
    Employee.employee_id,
    Employee.department_id
FROM Employee
RIGHT JOIN CTE ON CTE.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR CTE.unique_department_id = 1;
```

## Most Efficient Query
The following query finds the primary department for each employee in a more efficient manner by eliminating the need for an additional CTE and using conditional aggregation:

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM
    Employee
WHERE
    primary_flag = 'Y'
UNION
SELECT
    employee_id,
    MIN(department_id) AS department_id
FROM
    Employee
GROUP BY
    employee_id
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) = 1;
```

## Window Function Query
The following query uses a window function to efficiently determine the primary department for each employee:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    department_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        employee_id, 
        department_id, 
        COUNT(employee_id) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id) AS ct, 
        primary_flag 
    FROM Employee
) AS sub
WHERE ct = 1 OR primary_flag = 'Y';
```

## Enhanced Window Function Query
The following is an enhanced version of the window function query that includes explicit referencing in the WHERE clause for better readability:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    department_id 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        employee_id, 
        department_id, 
        COUNT(employee_id) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id) AS ct, 
        primary_flag 
    FROM Employee
) AS sub
WHERE 
    sub.ct = 1 OR sub.primary_flag = 'Y';
```

## Explanation
1. **User's Query**:
   - **WITH CTE AS (...)**: Creates a common table expression (CTE) that calculates the number of unique departments each employee belongs to.
   - **RIGHT JOIN CTE ON CTE.employee_id = Employee.employee_id**: Performs a right join to include all employees from the CTE, even those without a department with `primary_flag = 'Y'`.
   - **WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR CTE.unique_department_id = 1**: Filters to include employees who either have a `primary_flag` set to 'Y' or belong to only one department.

2. **Most Efficient Query**:
   - **`WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'`**: Selects all records where the `primary_flag` is set to 'Y'. This includes employees who have multiple departments and have explicitly set a primary department.
   - **`UNION`**: Combines the results with the next query to ensure all primary departments are included.
   - **`MIN(department_id) AS department_id`**: For employees who belong to only one department, selects that department. Using `MIN()` is just a way to get the single department since there is only one.
   - **`HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) = 1`**: Ensures that only employees who belong to exactly one department are included in this part of the result.

3. **Window Function Query**:
   - **`COUNT(employee_id) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id)`**: Uses a window function to count the number of departments each employee belongs to without requiring a GROUP BY clause.
   - **`WHERE ct = 1 OR primary_flag = 'Y'`**: Filters the result to include employees who either belong to only one department or have the primary department set.

4. **Enhanced Window Function Query**:
   - **Explicit Referencing**: Adds `sub.` before the column names in the WHERE clause to make the query more readable and to clearly show that the conditions are applied to the derived table (`sub`).

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employee` table. The complexity arises from the filtering and aggregation operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique employees and departments.

## Key Concepts
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Conditional Aggregation
- Window Functions for efficient row-wise calculations
- RIGHT JOIN, UNION, and PARTITION BY to combine results
- Filtering with WHERE and HAVING clauses

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Employee` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- These queries can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
