# Count Salary Categories

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Accounts` that contains information about monthly incomes for various bank accounts, calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are defined as follows:

1. **Low Salary**: All salaries strictly less than $20,000.
2. **Average Salary**: All salaries in the inclusive range of $20,000 to $50,000.
3. **High Salary**: All salaries strictly greater than $50,000.

The result should contain all three categories, with a count of 0 if there are no accounts in a category.

## Table Structure
**Accounts** table:
| Column Name | Type | Description                             |
|-------------|------|-----------------------------------------|
| account_id  | int  | Unique identifier for each bank account |
| income      | int  | Monthly income of the bank account      |

- `account_id`: Represents the ID of each bank account.
- `income`: Represents the monthly income for each bank account.

## Example Input

**Accounts** table:
| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

```sql
SELECT 
    'Low Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts
WHERE 
    income < 20000

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Average Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts
WHERE 
    income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'High Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts
WHERE 
    income > 50000;

```

### Explanation of Input Data
- Account 3, Account 6, and Account 8 have incomes greater than $50,000, which places them in the **High Salary** category.
- Account 2 has an income less than $20,000, placing it in the **Low Salary** category.
- There are no accounts with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000, so the **Average Salary** category will have a count of 0.

## Expected Output

| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |

### Explanation of Output
- **Low Salary**: There is 1 account (Account 2) with an income below $20,000.
- **Average Salary**: No accounts fall within the income range of $20,000 to $50,000.
- **High Salary**: There are 3 accounts (Accounts 3, 6, and 8) with incomes above $50,000.

## Solution Outline

1. **Categorize Incomes**:
   - Use conditional aggregation to categorize each income into **Low Salary**, **Average Salary**, or **High Salary**.

2. **Count Accounts in Each Category**:
   - For each category, count the number of accounts that fall within the specified salary range.

3. **Ensure All Categories Are Represented**:
   - Ensure the result includes all three categories, with a count of 0 if there are no accounts in that category.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Accounts` table, as each row is evaluated once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the result is a fixed number of categories (3).

## Key Concepts
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Using conditional counts based on salary ranges to count accounts in each category.
- **Handling Missing Categories**: Ensuring that all categories are represented even if the count is zero.

## Additional Notes
- This solution is designed to work regardless of the number of accounts in the `Accounts` table and is flexible enough to handle cases where no accounts fall into certain categories.

## Difficulty
Medium
