# Not Boring Movies

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find movies from the `Cinema` table that have an odd ID and are not described as 'boring'. The query should return the movie details sorted by rating in descending order.

The `Cinema` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| movie         | varchar |
| description   | varchar |
| rating        | float   |

```sql
SELECT 
    ID,
    MOVIE,
    DESCRIPTION,
    RATING
FROM CINEMA
WHERE
    ID % 2 = 1 AND DESCRIPTION != 'boring'
ORDER BY RATING DESC;
```

## Explanation
1. **ID % 2 = 1**: Selects movies with an odd ID.
2. **DESCRIPTION != 'boring'**: Filters out movies described as 'boring'.
3. **ORDER BY RATING DESC**: Sorts the selected movies in descending order by rating.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Cinema` table. The query scans through the table to find matching rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of matching movies.

## Key Concepts
- SQL SELECT statement
- Filtering results with WHERE clause
- Sorting results with ORDER BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Cinema` table is populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
