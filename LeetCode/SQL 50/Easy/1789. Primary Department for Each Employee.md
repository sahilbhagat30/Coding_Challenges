# Primary Department for Each Employee

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the primary department for each employee. If an employee belongs to only one department, that department is their primary department. If an employee belongs to multiple departments, the department with the `primary_flag` set to 'Y' is their primary department. The query should return the employee ID and the department ID.

The `Employee` table has the following structure:

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| department_id    | int     |
| primary_flag     | char    |

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS unique_department_id
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
)
SELECT
    Employee.employee_id,
    Employee.department_id
FROM Employee
RIGHT JOIN CTE ON CTE.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR CTE.unique_department_id = 1;
```

## Explanation
1. **WITH CTE AS (...)**: Creates a common table expression (CTE) that calculates the number of unique departments each employee belongs to.
2. **COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS unique_department_id**: Counts the number of distinct departments for each employee.
3. **RIGHT JOIN CTE ON CTE.employee_id = Employee.employee_id**: Performs a right join to include all employees from the CTE, even those without a department with `primary_flag = 'Y'`.
4. **WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR CTE.unique_department_id = 1**: Filters to include employees who either have a `primary_flag` set to 'Y' or belong to only one department.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employee` table. The complexity arises from the grouping, joining, and filtering operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique employees and departments.

## Key Concepts
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to precompute results
- RIGHT JOIN to include employees with specific conditions
- Filtering results with WHERE clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Employee` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
