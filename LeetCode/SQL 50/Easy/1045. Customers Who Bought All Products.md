# Customers Who Bought All Products

## Problem Statement
Given a table of customers and a table of products, retrieve the customer IDs of customers who have bought every product in the `PRODUCT` table. The output should display only the `customer_id` for customers who have purchased all available products.

## Table Structure
**CUSTOMER** table:
| Column Name  | Type     | Description                              |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| customer_id  | integer  | Unique identifier for each customer      |
| product_key  | integer  | Identifier for the product purchased     |

**PRODUCT** table:
| Column Name  | Type     | Description                              |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| product_key  | integer  | Unique identifier for each product       |

## Example Input

**CUSTOMER** table:
| customer_id | product_key |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 2           |
| 3           | 1           |

**PRODUCT** table:
| product_key |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 2           |

### Explanation of Input Data
- In this example, there are two products (with `product_key` values 1 and 2).
- Customer 1 and Customer 2 have purchased both products.
- Customer 3 has purchased only one product.

## Expected Output

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 2           |

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id
FROM
    CUSTOMER
GROUP BY 
    CUSTOMER_ID
HAVING 
    count(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PRODUCT)
```

### Explanation of Output
- Customer 1 and Customer 2 have purchased all products listed in the `PRODUCT` table. Therefore, these customers are included in the result.
- Customer 3 has not bought all products, so they are excluded from the result.

## Solution Outline

1. **Counting Products per Customer**:
   - In the `CUSTOMER` table, we count the distinct `product_key` values purchased by each `customer_id`.

2. **Filtering with `HAVING` Clause**:
   - Using a `HAVING` clause, we filter customers whose distinct product count matches the total number of products in the `PRODUCT` table. This ensures that only customers who have bought every product are included.

3. **Subquery for Total Product Count**:
   - We use a subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PRODUCT)` to get the total number of unique products available, which is compared to each customer’s distinct product count.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the `CUSTOMER` table and m is the number of rows in the `PRODUCT` table. The subquery and grouping add to the complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store intermediate results for each unique `customer_id`.

## Key Concepts
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group purchases by each customer.
- **Subquery**: The subquery finds the total number of products to compare against each customer’s purchase count.
- **Filtering with `HAVING`**: The `HAVING` clause enables filtering based on aggregate conditions.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes that there are no duplicate purchases of the same product by a customer.
- The query is effective for scenarios where we need to verify if each customer has completed a set of purchases.
