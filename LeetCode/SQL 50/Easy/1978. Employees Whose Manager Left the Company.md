# Find Customer Referee

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the names of customers who do not have a referee with an ID of 2. 

The `Customer` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| referee_id    | int     |

- `referee_id` can be NULL, indicating that the customer does not have a referee.

## Explanation

The query utilizes the `COALESCE` function and a `WHERE` clause to achieve the desired results.

**1. COALESCE Function:**

The query employs the `COALESCE` function to handle NULL values in the `referee_id` column. `COALESCE` takes multiple arguments and returns the first non-NULL value. In this case, if `referee_id` is NULL, it is treated as 0 for comparison purposes.

**2. WHERE Clause:**

The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the `referee_id` value. Customers whose `referee_id` is not equal to 2 (including those with NULL values) will be included in the final results.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table. The query scans through the table to identify matching rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the size of the result set depends on the number of customers without a referee with ID 2.

## Key Concepts

- SQL SELECT statement
- COALESCE function
- Filtering results with WHERE clause

## Additional Notes

- Ensure data exists in the `Customer` table for testing the query.
- This query is compatible with any SQL environment supporting standard SQL syntax.
