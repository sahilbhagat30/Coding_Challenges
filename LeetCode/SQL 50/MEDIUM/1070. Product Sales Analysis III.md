# Product Sales Analysis III

## Problem Statement
Given a table `sales` that contains product sales data, retrieve the first year of sales, quantity sold, and price for each product. The output should display the product ID, the first year of sales (as `first_year`), quantity, and price.

## Table Structure
**sales** table:
| Column Name | Type     | Description                        |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| product_id  | integer  | Unique identifier for each product |
| year        | integer  | Year of the sale                   |
| quantity    | integer  | Quantity of the product sold       |
| price       | decimal  | Sale price of the product          |

## Example Input

| product_id | year | quantity | price |
|------------|------|----------|-------|
| 1          | 2019 | 100      | 10    |
| 1          | 2020 | 200      | 15    |
| 2          | 2018 | 150      | 20    |
| 2          | 2019 | 250      | 25    |

### Explanation of Input Data
- For `product_id` 1, the first year of sales is 2019.
- For `product_id` 2, the first year of sales is 2018.

## Expected Output

| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1          | 2019       | 100      | 10    |
| 2          | 2018       | 150      | 20    |

```sql
select s.product_id, s.year as first_year, s.quantity, s.price
from sales as s
where (s.product_id, year) in 
(select product_id, min(year) from sales group by product_id); 
```

### Explanation of Output Columns
- **product_id**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **first_year**: The first year that the product was sold.
- **quantity**: Quantity of the product sold in the first year.
- **price**: Sale price of the product in the first year.

## Solution Outline

1. **Subquery to Find First Year**:
   - A subquery is used to find the earliest year (`min(year)`) of sales for each `product_id`. This identifies the first year a product was sold.

2. **Main Query with Filtering**:
   - In the main query, we select data from `sales` where the `(product_id, year)` combination matches `(product_id, min(year))` from the subquery.
   - This ensures only the first yearâ€™s record for each product is included in the result.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The query outputs `product_id`, `first_year` (as `year`), `quantity`, and `price` for each product's initial sale.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the `sales` table. The `GROUP BY` and `MIN` aggregate function add computational overhead.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the subquery needs to temporarily store the earliest year for each product.

## Key Concepts
- **Subqueries**: The subquery finds the minimum year for each product.
- **Filtering with Tuples**: `(product_id, year) IN (...)` allows filtering on multiple columns simultaneously.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Using `GROUP BY` to identify the first year of sales for each product.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes each product has at least one entry in the `sales` table.
- The tuple filter `(product_id, year) IN (...)` is a useful approach for matching specific multi-column values.
