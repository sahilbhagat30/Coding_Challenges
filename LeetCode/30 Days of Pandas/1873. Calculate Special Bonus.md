# Calculate Special Bonus

## Problem Statement
Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is shown in the following example.

## Example 1:

**Input**:
```
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
```

**Output**:
```
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
```

**Explanation**:
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even `employee_id`. The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'. The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.

## Function Definition
```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    if employees.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=['employee_id', 'bonus'])

    mask = (employees['employee_id'] % 2 == 1) & (employees['name'].str[0] != 'M')
    employees.loc[~mask, 'salary'] = 0
    bonus_df = employees[['employee_id', 'salary']].rename(columns={'salary': 'bonus'})
    return bonus_df
```

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    if employees.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame(columns=['employee_id', 'bonus'])

    employees['bonus'] = ((employees['employee_id'] % 2 == 1) & (employees['name'].str[0] != 'M')) * employees['salary']
    return employees[['employee_id','bonus']].sort_values(by="employee_id")
```

## Example Usage
```python
# Example DataFrame
employees_data = {
    'employee_id': [2, 3, 7, 8, 9],
    'name': ['Meir', 'Michael', 'Addilyn', 'Juan', 'Kannon'],
    'salary': [3000, 3800, 7400, 6100, 7700]
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)

# Calculating special bonus
bonus_df = calculate_special_bonus(employees_df)
print(bonus_df)
```

**Output**:
```
   employee_id  bonus
0            2      0
1            3      0
2            7   7400
3            8      0
4            9   7700
```

## Explanation
1. **Bonus Calculation**: The function uses a mask to filter employees with odd `employee_id` values whose names do not start with 'M'. For these employees, the bonus is set to their salary; otherwise, it is set to 0.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of rows in the DataFrame, as each row is checked for conditions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the operation is performed in place without additional memory usage.

## Key Concepts
- Filtering and modifying DataFrames using Pandas.

## Difficulty
Easy
