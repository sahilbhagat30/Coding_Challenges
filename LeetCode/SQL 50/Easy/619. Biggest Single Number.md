# Biggest Single Number

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the largest number that appears exactly once in the `MyNumbers` table. The query should return the maximum value among the numbers that appear only once.

The `MyNumbers` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| num           | int     |

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM MyNumbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(num) = 1;
```

## Explanation
1. **GROUP BY num**: Groups the numbers by their value.
2. **HAVING COUNT(num) = 1**: Filters the grouped results to include only numbers that appear once.
3. **SELECT MAX(num)**: Finds the largest number among those that appear only once.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `MyNumbers` table. The complexity arises from the grouping and filtering operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique numbers that appear only once.

## Key Concepts
- GROUP BY clause
- Filtering groups with HAVING clause
- Finding the maximum value with MAX()

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `MyNumbers` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
