# Queries Quality and Percentage

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to calculate the quality and poor query percentage for each query. The query should return the query name, the quality (calculated as the average rating divided by position, rounded to two decimal places), and the poor query percentage (the percentage of queries with a rating less than 3, rounded to two decimal places).

The `Queries` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| query_name    | varchar |
| rating        | int     |
| position      | int     |

```sql
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*), 2), 0) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
    queries
WHERE
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    query_name;
```

## Explanation
1. **ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality**: Calculates the quality for each query by taking the average of the rating divided by the position, rounded to two decimal places.
2. **COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*), 2), 0) AS poor_query_percentage**: Calculates the percentage of queries with a rating less than 3, rounding it to two decimal places, and uses `COALESCE` to handle any null values.
3. **GROUP BY query_name**: Groups the results by query name to calculate the quality and poor query percentage for each query.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Queries` table. The complexity arises from the aggregation and grouping operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique query names.

## Key Concepts
- SQL GROUP BY clause
- Calculating averages and percentages
- Handling null values with COALESCE

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Queries` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
