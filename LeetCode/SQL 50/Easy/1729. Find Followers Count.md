# Find Followers Count

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of distinct followers for each user. The query should return the user ID and the count of followers for each user, ordered by user ID.

The `Followers` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| user_id       | int     |
| follower_id   | int     |

```sql
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM
    Followers
GROUP BY 
    user_id
ORDER BY
    user_id;
```

## Explanation
1. **COUNT(DISTINCT follower_id)**: Counts the number of distinct followers for each user.
2. **GROUP BY user_id**: Groups the results by `user_id` to calculate the follower count for each user.
3. **ORDER BY user_id**: Orders the results by `user_id` in ascending order.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Followers` table. The complexity arises from the grouping and counting operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique users.

## Key Concepts
- SQL GROUP BY clause
- COUNT with DISTINCT to find unique followers
- Ordering results with ORDER BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Followers` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
