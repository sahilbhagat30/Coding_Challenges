# Find Customer Referee

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the names of customers who do not have a referee with an ID of 2. 

The `Customer` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

- `referee_id` can be NULL, indicating that the customer does not have a referee.

```sql
SELECT
    name
FROM    
    Customer  
WHERE 
    COALESCE(referee_id,0) != 2 
```

## Explanation
1. **COALESCE Function**: The query uses the `COALESCE` function to treat NULL values in `referee_id` as 0. This allows for a comparison that includes customers without referees.
2. **WHERE Clause**: The condition filters out customers whose `referee_id` is 2.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table. The query scans through the table to find matching rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of matching customers.

## Key Concepts
- SQL SELECT statement
- COALESCE function
- Filtering results with WHERE clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Customer` table is populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
