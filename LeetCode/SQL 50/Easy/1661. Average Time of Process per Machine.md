# Employee Bonus

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the names of employees and their bonus if they have a bonus less than 1000 or no bonus at all. The query should return the employee name and the bonus amount.

The `Employee` and `Bonus` tables have the following structures:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| empId         | int     |
| name          | varchar |

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| empId         | int     |
| bonus         | int     |

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    bonus
FROM Employee E
LEFT JOIN Bonus B ON E.empId = B.empId
WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL;
```

## Explanation
1. **LEFT JOIN Bonus B ON E.empId = B.empId**: Performs a left join between the `Employee` and `Bonus` tables to include all employees, even those without a bonus.
2. **WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL**: Filters the results to include only employees with a bonus less than 1000 or those without any bonus.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employee` table. The complexity arises from the join and filtering operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of employees meeting the condition.

## Key Concepts
- SQL LEFT JOIN
- Filtering results with WHERE clause
- Handling null values

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Employee` and `Bonus` tables are populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
