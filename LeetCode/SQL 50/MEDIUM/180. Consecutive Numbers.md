# Consecutive Numbers

## Problem Statement
Given a table `logs` containing log entries with sequential IDs and associated numbers, write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear consecutively three times or more. The output should contain only these numbers, without duplicates.

## Table Structure
**logs** table:
| Column Name | Type     | Description                           |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| id          | integer  | Unique identifier for each log entry  |
| num         | integer  | Number associated with each log entry |

## Example Input

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
| 8  | 2   |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The number `1` appears consecutively three times in the first three rows.
- The number `2` appears consecutively three times in the last three rows.

## Expected Output

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |
| 2               |

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        num,
        LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_num,
        LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_num
    FROM 
        logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT 
    num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM 
    CTE
WHERE 
    num = prev_num AND num = next_num;
```

### Explanation of Output
- Both `1` and `2` appear in consecutive sequences of three or more in the `logs` table. Therefore, they should be included in the output.

## Solution Outline

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**:
   - The CTE retrieves each `num` in the `logs` table along with the previous (`prev_num`) and next (`next_num`) values for each row, ordered by `id`.
   - `LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id)` provides the previous row's `num`, and `LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id)` provides the next row's `num`.

2. **Filtering for Consecutive Numbers**:
   - In the main query, we select only those rows where `num` matches both `prev_num` and `next_num`, indicating that `num` appears three times consecutively.

3. **Removing Duplicates**:
   - `SELECT DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each number is listed only once in the output, even if it appears in multiple consecutive sequences.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `logs` table. The window functions `LAG` and `LEAD` each process the table once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the intermediate CTE stores each row with additional columns for the previous and next values.

## Key Concepts
- **Window Functions**: `LAG()` and `LEAD()` are used to access adjacent row values.
- **Filtering with Conditions**: We use a combination of conditions in the `WHERE` clause to detect sequences of three consecutive identical numbers.
- **Removing Duplicates**: `SELECT DISTINCT` ensures each `num` appears only once in the output.

## Additional Notes
- This solution identifies sequences of three or more consecutive identical numbers in the `logs` table.
- The approach can be generalized to find different sequence lengths by modifying the `WHERE` conditions.
