# Students and Examinations

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of examinations each student attended for each subject. The query should return the student ID, student name, subject name, and the count of attended exams. The result should be ordered by student ID and subject name.

The `Students`, `Subjects`, and `Examinations` tables have the following structures:

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| student_id     | int     |
| student_name   | varchar |

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| subject_name   | varchar |

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| student_id     | int     |
| subject_name   | varchar |

```sql
SELECT
  S.student_id,
  S.student_name,
  SB.subject_name,
  COUNT(E.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM
    Students S
CROSS JOIN 
    Subjects SB
LEFT JOIN 
    Examinations E ON
    E.student_id = S.student_id AND
    E.subject_name = SB.subject_name
GROUP BY
    S.student_id, S.student_name, SB.subject_name
ORDER BY
    S.student_id, SB.subject_name;
```

## Explanation
1. **CROSS JOIN Subjects SB**: Creates a Cartesian product of students and subjects, ensuring each student is paired with each subject.
2. **LEFT JOIN Examinations E ON E.student_id = S.student_id AND E.subject_name = SB.subject_name**: Left joins the `Examinations` table to count the number of exams each student attended for each subject.
3. **COUNT(E.student_id) AS attended_exams**: Counts the number of attended exams for each student and subject combination.
4. **GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SB.subject_name**: Groups the results by student ID, student name, and subject name to calculate the count for each combination.
5. **ORDER BY S.student_id, SB.subject_name**: Orders the results by student ID and subject name.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the `Students` table and m is the number of rows in the `Subjects` table. The complexity arises from the cross join and grouping operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of students and subjects.

## Key Concepts
- SQL CROSS JOIN
- LEFT JOIN for optional matches
- Grouping results with GROUP BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Students`, `Subjects`, and `Examinations` tables are populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
