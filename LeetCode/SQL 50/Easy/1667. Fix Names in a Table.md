# Fix Names in a Table

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Users` containing user IDs and names, write a SQL query to standardize the format of the names. Specifically, convert each name to have only the first letter of each word capitalized, with the rest of the letters in lowercase. 

## Table Structure
**Users** table:
| Column Name | Type    | Description                        |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| user_id     | int     | Unique identifier for each user   |
| name        | varchar | User's name in inconsistent format |

- `user_id`: Represents the unique ID for each user.
- `name`: Represents the user's name, which may have inconsistent capitalization.

## Example Input

**Users** table:
| user_id | name       |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | "aLICE"    |
| 2       | "bOB"      |
| 3       | "cHaRlIe"  |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The names are in inconsistent capitalization formats, and the goal is to standardize them to "Title Case" (first letter of each word capitalized, all other letters lowercase).

## Expected Output

| user_id | name     |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | "Alice"  |
| 2       | "Bob"    |
| 3       | "Charlie"|

### Explanation of Output
- Each name has been converted to "Title Case" format:
  - "aLICE" becomes "Alice"
  - "bOB" becomes "Bob"
  - "cHaRlIe" becomes "Charlie"

  ```sql
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    CONCAT(
    UPPER(SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1)),
    LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2, LENGTH(name)))
    ) name
FROM 
    USERS
ORDER BY
    USER_ID
  ```

## Solution Outline

1. **Apply Title Case Conversion**:
   - Use SQL string functions to capitalize the first letter of each name and convert the remaining letters to lowercase.

2. **Database-Specific Functions**:
   - Some databases support functions such as `INITCAP()` (in Oracle and PostgreSQL) that directly convert text to "Title Case".
   - In MySQL, you may need to combine `UPPER()` and `LOWER()` functions or use additional logic to achieve the same effect.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Users` table, as each row's name needs to be reformatted.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the result set requires space for each row in the `Users` table.

## Key Concepts
- **String Manipulation**: The solution involves converting text to a consistent format.
- **Database Functions**: Knowledge of functions like `INITCAP()`, `UPPER()`, and `LOWER()` is essential to implement text formatting in SQL.

## Additional Notes
- This solution standardizes names across different capitalization formats.
- If the database does not support direct "Title Case" functions, additional processing with string functions may be required.
