# Game Play Analysis IV

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Activity` that tracks the game play activity of players, write a SQL query to calculate the fraction of players who played the game for the first time on the day immediately following their previous play session. The fraction should be calculated as the number of players who meet this condition divided by the total number of distinct players. Round the result to two decimal places.

## Table Structure

### Activity Table
| Column Name | Type    | Description                            |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| player_id   | int     | Unique identifier for each player      |
| event_date  | date    | Date when the player played the game   |

- `player_id`: Represents the unique ID of each player.
- `event_date`: Represents the date of each game session for a player.

## Example Input

**Activity Table**
| player_id | event_date |
|-----------|------------|
| 1         | 2023-01-01 |
| 1         | 2023-01-02 |
| 1         | 2023-01-03 |
| 2         | 2023-01-01 |
| 2         | 2023-01-03 |
| 3         | 2023-01-01 |

### Explanation of Input Data
- `player_id` 1 played on three consecutive days.
- `player_id` 2 played on non-consecutive days.
- `player_id` 3 only played once.

## Expected Output

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

### Explanation of Output
The fraction is calculated by dividing the number of players who played on the day immediately after their previous play session by the total number of unique players. In this example, only `player_id` 1 meets this condition.

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT PLAYER_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PLAYER_ID) FROM ACTIVITY), 2) AS fraction
FROM 
    ACTIVITY
WHERE 
    (PLAYER_ID, DATE_SUB(EVENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) IN 
    (SELECT PLAYER_ID, MIN(EVENT_DATE) FROM ACTIVITY GROUP BY PLAYER_ID);
```

## Solution Outline

1. **Identify Players Who Played Consecutively**:
   - Use a subquery to find players who played for the first time immediately after their previous session by comparing `event_date` to the previous day.

2. **Calculate the Fraction**:
   - Count the players who met the above condition and divide by the total distinct player count in `Activity`. Round the result to two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the `Activity` table. This complexity arises due to grouping and subquery operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the result set requires space for all unique players in `Activity`.

## Key Concepts
- **Self-Joins and Subqueries**: Using subqueries to determine consecutive play sessions.
- **Division and Rounding**: Calculating a fraction and rounding to two decimal places.
- **Grouping by Player ID**: Grouping by `player_id` to find distinct play sessions for each player.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes all dates are in consecutive order in the `Activity` table for each player. If not, further filtering may be needed.
- Ensure to use `ROUND` to meet the specified output format.
