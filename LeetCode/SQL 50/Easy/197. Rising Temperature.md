# Rising Temperature

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find all records from the `WEATHER` table where the temperature is higher than the temperature recorded on the previous day. The result should include the `id` and `recordDate` of those records.

The `WEATHER` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| ID            | int     |
| RECORDDATE    | date    |
| TEMPERATURE   | int     |

## Example Input
**WEATHER Table:**

| ID | RECORDDATE | TEMPERATURE |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2000-12-14 | 3           |
| 2  | 2000-12-15 | 5           |
| 3  | 2000-12-16 | 4           |
| 4  | 2000-12-17 | 6           |

## Example Output
| ID |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
        ID,
        RECORDDATE,
        TEMPERATURE,
        LAG(TEMPERATURE, 1) OVER (ORDER BY RECORDDATE) AS previousDayTemperature,
        LAG(RECORDDATE, 1) OVER (ORDER BY RECORDDATE) AS previousRecordDate
    FROM
        WEATHER
)
SELECT
    ID
FROM
    CTE
WHERE
    previousDayTemperature - TEMPERATURE < 0 
    AND RECORDDATE = DATE_ADD(previousRecordDate, INTERVAL '1 DAY');
```
```sql
SELECT
    W.ID
FROM
    WEATHER W
JOIN 
    WEATHER WI ON  W.RECORDDATE = DATE_ADD(WI.RECORDDATE, INTERVAL '1 DAY')
WHERE
    WI.TEMPERATURE < W.TEMPERATURE
```
## Explanation
- For the record on `2000-12-15`, the temperature (5) is higher than the previous day's temperature (3).
- For the record on `2000-12-17`, the temperature (6) is higher than the previous day's temperature (4).
- The record on `2000-12-16` is not included because the temperature (4) is not higher than the previous day's temperature (5).

## SQL Query Explanation
- The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the previous day's temperature and record date using the `LAG` function.
- It then filters the results to find records where the current day's temperature is greater than the previous day's temperature and ensures that the record date is exactly one day after the previous record date.

## Key Concepts
- SQL window functions (LAG)
- Date manipulation and comparison
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
