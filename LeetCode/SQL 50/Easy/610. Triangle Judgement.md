# Triangle Judgement

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to determine if the sides of a triangle (represented by columns `X`, `Y`, and `Z`) can form a valid triangle. The result should include all columns and a new column that indicates whether the sides form a valid triangle (`Yes` or `No`).

The `Triangle` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| X           | int  |
| Y           | int  |
| Z           | int  |

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    CASE WHEN (X < Y + Z) AND (Y < X + Z) AND (Z < X + Y) THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS triangle
FROM 
    Triangle;
```

## Explanation
1. **CASE WHEN (X < Y + Z) AND (Y < X + Z) AND (Z < X + Y)**: Checks whether the three sides (`X`, `Y`, and `Z`) satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.
2. **THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS triangle**: If the conditions are met, the output is 'Yes', indicating a valid triangle. Otherwise, the output is 'No'.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Triangle` table. The complexity arises from evaluating the conditions for each row.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of rows in the `Triangle` table.

## Key Concepts
- CASE statement for conditional logic
- Evaluating multiple conditions to determine the validity of a triangle

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Triangle` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
