# Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher. The query should return the teacher ID and the count of unique subjects taught by that teacher.

The `Teacher` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| teacher_id    | int     |
| subject_id    | int     |

```sql
SELECT
    teacher_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM
    Teacher
GROUP BY
    teacher_id;
```

## Explanation
1. **COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)**: Counts the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher.
2. **GROUP BY teacher_id**: Groups the results by teacher ID to calculate the unique subject count for each teacher.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Teacher` table. The complexity arises from the grouping and counting operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique teachers.

## Key Concepts
- SQL GROUP BY clause
- COUNT with DISTINCT to find unique values

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Teacher` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
