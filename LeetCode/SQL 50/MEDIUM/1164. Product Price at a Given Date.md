# Product Price at a Given Date

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Products` that tracks price changes over time for different products, write a SQL query to retrieve the price of a specified product on a particular date. If the product has multiple price records before the given date, return the price from the latest date before or on the specified date. If no price record exists for that product before or on the given date, return `NULL`.

## Table Structure
**Products** table:
| Column Name | Type     | Description                                     |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| product_id  | integer  | Unique identifier for each product              |
| start_date  | date     | Date when the price became effective            |
| end_date    | date     | Date when the price ceased to be effective      |
| price       | decimal  | Price of the product during the effective period|

- `product_id`: Represents the ID of each product.
- `start_date`: Represents the start date when the price became effective.
- `end_date`: Represents the end date for the price. If `end_date` is `NULL`, the price is still active.

## Example Input

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price |
|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1          | 2022-01-01 | 2022-02-01 | 100   |
| 1          | 2022-02-02 | NULL       | 120   |
| 2          | 2022-01-10 | 2022-01-20 | 200   |
| 2          | 2022-01-21 | 2022-03-01 | 210   |

### Explanation of Input Data
- `product_id` 1 has two price records. The price was `100` from `2022-01-01` to `2022-02-01` and changed to `120` on `2022-02-02` with no end date, indicating that it is still active.
- `product_id` 2 has a price of `200` from `2022-01-10` to `2022-01-20`, which then changes to `210` starting on `2022-01-21` and remains effective until `2022-03-01`.

## Expected Output

For example, if we are looking for the price of `product_id` 1 on `2022-02-15`:

| product_id | price |
|------------|-------|
| 1          | 120   |

### Explanation of Output
- For `product_id` 1 on `2022-02-15`, the price of `120` applies because it became effective on `2022-02-02` and is still active, covering the specified date.

## Solution Outline

1. **Filter by Date Range**:
   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where the specified date falls within the `start_date` and `end_date` range.
   - For rows where `end_date` is `NULL`, assume the price is still active.

2. **Order by Date**:
   - Sort results by `start_date` in descending order to prioritize the most recent applicable price.

3. **Limit to One Result**:
   - Use `LIMIT 1` (or equivalent syntax depending on the SQL database) to return only the latest price record before or on the specified date.

## Example Query

The following query demonstrates how to retrieve the price for a product on a specific date:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    price
FROM 
    Products
WHERE 
    product_id = ? 
    AND start_date <= '2022-02-15'
    AND (end_date >= '2022-02-15' OR end_date IS NULL)
ORDER BY 
    start_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation of Output
- For `product_id` 1 on `2022-02-15`, the price of `120` applies because it became effective on `2022-02-02` and is still active, covering the specified date.

## Solution Outline

1. **Filter by Date Range**:
   - Filter rows where the specified date falls within the `start_date` and `end_date` range.
   - For rows where `end_date` is `NULL`, assume the price is still active.

2. **Order by Date**:
   - Sort results by `start_date` in descending order to prioritize the most recent applicable price.

3. **Limit to One Result**:
   - Return only the latest price record before or on the specified date.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of rows for the product in `Products`, due to sorting by `start_date`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only one row is retrieved.

## Key Concepts
- **Filtering by Date Range**: Use `start_date` and `end_date` conditions to find relevant price records.
- **Handling NULL Values**: Treat `NULL` in `end_date` as an indication of a still-active price.
- **Ordering for Most Recent Record**: Use `ORDER BY` to get the most recent effective price before or on the specified date.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes that each product has unique non-overlapping `start_date` ranges.
- The query is designed to handle cases where there may be no applicable price, in which case it returns `NULL`.
