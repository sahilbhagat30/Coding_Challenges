# Average Selling Price

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to calculate the average selling price of each product based on the prices and units sold. The query should return the product ID and the average selling price, rounded to two decimal places.

The `Prices` and `UnitsSold` tables have the following structures:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| price         | float   |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| units         | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |

```sql
SELECT 
    Prices.product_id,
    ROUND(SUM(Prices.price * UnitsSold.units) / SUM(UnitsSold.units), 2) AS average_price
FROM
    Prices
JOIN UnitsSold ON UnitsSold.product_id = Prices.product_id 
    AND UnitsSold.purchase_date BETWEEN Prices.start_date AND Prices.end_date
GROUP BY 
    Prices.product_id;
```

## Explanation
1. **JOIN UnitsSold ON UnitsSold.product_id = Prices.product_id AND UnitsSold.purchase_date BETWEEN Prices.start_date AND Prices.end_date**: Joins the `Prices` and `UnitsSold` tables based on product ID and ensures that the purchase date falls within the valid pricing period.
2. **ROUND(SUM(Prices.price * UnitsSold.units) / SUM(UnitsSold.units), 2)**: Calculates the weighted average selling price for each product and rounds it to two decimal places.
3. **GROUP BY Prices.product_id**: Groups the results by product ID to calculate the average for each product.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the `Prices` table and m is the number of rows in the `UnitsSold` table. The complexity arises from the join and grouping operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique products.

## Key Concepts
- SQL JOIN statement
- Calculating weighted averages
- Grouping results with GROUP BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Prices` and `UnitsSold` tables are populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
