# Confirmation Rate

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to calculate the confirmation rate for each user. The confirmation rate is defined as the ratio of confirmed actions to the total actions (confirmed and timeout) for each user.

The `Signups` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |

The `Confirmations` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| action      | varchar |

- The `action` column can contain values such as 'confirmed' and 'timeout'.

```sql
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    COALESCE(ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN ct.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 /
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN ct.action IN ('confirmed', 'timeout') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0), 2), 0) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
    Signups s
LEFT JOIN 
    Confirmations ct ON ct.user_id = s.user_id 
GROUP BY
    s.user_id;
```


## Explanation
1. **LEFT JOIN**: The query uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the `Signups` and `Confirmations` tables based on `user_id`. This ensures that all users from the `Signups` table are included, even if they have no corresponding entries in the `Confirmations` table.
2. **SUM with CASE**: The query calculates the number of confirmed actions and the total actions (confirmed and timeout) using conditional aggregation with the `SUM` function and `CASE` statements.
3. **COALESCE and ROUND**: The `COALESCE` function is used to handle cases where the denominator might be zero, ensuring that the confirmation rate is set to 0 in such cases. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Signups` and `Confirmations` tables. The query processes each row to calculate the confirmation rates.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of users.

## Key Concepts
- SQL JOIN operations
- Conditional aggregation with SUM and CASE
- Handling NULL values with COALESCE

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Signups` and `Confirmations` tables are populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
