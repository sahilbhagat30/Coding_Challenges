# Delete Duplicate Emails

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Person` that contains information about peopleâ€™s IDs and email addresses, delete all duplicate entries in the table so that each email address is unique. Only keep the row with the smallest `Id` for each duplicate email.

## Table Structure
**Person** table:
| Column Name | Type    | Description                       |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Id          | int     | Unique identifier for each person |
| Email       | varchar | Email address of the person       |

- `Id`: Represents the unique ID for each person.
- `Email`: Represents the email address of each person, which may have duplicates.

## Example Input

**Person** table:
| Id  | Email              |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 1   | "john@example.com" |
| 2   | "bob@example.com"  |
| 3   | "john@example.com" |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The email "john@example.com" appears twice with different `Id` values (1 and 3).

## Expected Output (Table after Deletion)

| Id  | Email              |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 1   | "john@example.com" |
| 2   | "bob@example.com"  |

```sql
DELETE p
FROM Person p
JOIN Person q
ON p.Email = q.Email
WHERE p.Id > q.Id;
```

### Explanation of Output
- Only the row with the smallest `Id` for each unique email is kept in the table.
- The row with `Id` 3, which is a duplicate of the email "john@example.com", is deleted.

## Solution Outline

1. **Self-Join on Email**:
   - Use a self-join on the `Person` table where the email addresses match (`p.Email = q.Email`).
   - Filter the rows by ensuring that only rows with a higher `Id` (`p.Id > q.Id`) are selected for deletion.

2. **Delete Duplicate Rows**:
   - For each duplicate email, delete the row with the higher `Id`, keeping only the row with the smallest `Id` for each email.

3. **Key Components of the Query**:
   - Use `DELETE p` to delete rows from the alias `p`.
   - The `WHERE` clause ensures that only duplicate rows (based on email and higher `Id`) are deleted.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the `Person` table, due to the self-join.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as deletions are performed in place within the table.

## Key Concepts
- **Self-Join**: Joining the table with itself to identify duplicate records based on email.
- **Conditional Deletion**: Using conditions to delete only the duplicates while keeping the smallest `Id`.

## Additional Notes
- This solution is effective for ensuring that only unique emails remain in the table.
- Ensure that the query is run with caution in production databases, as it involves deleting data.
