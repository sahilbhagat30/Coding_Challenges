# Monthly Transactions I

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to summarize transaction data on a monthly basis. The goal is to count the total number of transactions and the number of approved transactions for each country, along with the total amount of transactions and approved transactions.

The `Transactions` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| trans_date    | date    |
| country       | varchar |
| amount        | int     |
| state         | varchar |

- The `state` column indicates whether a transaction is 'approved' or not.

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(t.trans_date,'%Y-%m') month,
    t.country,
    COUNT(t.trans_date)trans_count,
    COUNT(a.trans_date) approved_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(t.amount),0) trans_total_amount,
    COALESCE(SUM(a.amount),0) approved_total_amount
FROM
    Transactions t
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions a on a.id = t.id and a.state = 'approved'
GROUP BY
    month, country
```

## Explanation
1. **DATE_FORMAT**: The query uses `DATE_FORMAT` to extract the year and month from the `trans_date` column, formatting it as 'YYYY-MM'.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: It performs a LEFT JOIN on the `Transactions` table to include all transactions and their corresponding approved transactions.
3. **COUNT and COALESCE**: The query counts the total transactions and approved transactions, using `COALESCE` to handle cases where there are no approved transactions, ensuring that the total amounts default to 0.

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(t.trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    t.country,
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
    COUNT(a.id) AS approved_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) AS trans_total_amount,
    COALESCE(SUM(a.amount), 0) AS approved_total_amount
FROM
    Transactions t
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions a ON a.id = t.id AND a.state = 'approved'
GROUP BY
    month, t.country;
```

## Optimized Query Explanation
- **COUNT(*)**: Using `COUNT(*)` instead of `COUNT(t.trans_date)` counts all rows regardless of NULL values, which can be slightly faster.
- **Alias for Clarity**: Adding `AS` for column aliases (e.g., `AS month`, `AS trans_count`) improves readability.
- **Consistent Column Reference**: In the `GROUP BY` clause, explicitly referencing `t.country` ensures clarity about which table the column is coming from.

## Differences from Original Code
- The optimized query uses `COUNT(*)` for counting total transactions, which is generally more efficient.
- It includes clearer aliases for the selected columns, enhancing readability.
- The `GROUP BY` clause explicitly references `t.country`, making it clear which table the column is sourced from.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Transactions` table. The query processes each transaction to calculate the required aggregates.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique months and countries.

## Key Concepts
- SQL aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM)
- DATE_FORMAT for date manipulation
- LEFT JOIN for including all records from one table

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Transactions` table is populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
