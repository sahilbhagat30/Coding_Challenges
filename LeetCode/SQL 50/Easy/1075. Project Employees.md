# Project Employees I

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to calculate the average years of experience for employees assigned to each project. The query should return the project ID and the average years of experience, rounded to two decimal places.

The `Project` and `Employee` tables have the following structures:

| Column Name     | Type    |
|-----------------|---------|
| project_id      | int     |
| employee_id     | int     |

| Column Name     | Type    |
|-----------------|---------|
| employee_id     | int     |
| experience_years| float   |

```sql
SELECT
    P.PROJECT_ID,
    ROUND(AVG(E.EXPERIENCE_YEARS), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    PROJECT P
JOIN 
    EMPLOYEE E
    ON E.EMPLOYEE_ID = P.EMPLOYEE_ID
GROUP BY 
    P.PROJECT_ID;
```

## Explanation
1. **JOIN EMPLOYEE E ON E.EMPLOYEE_ID = P.EMPLOYEE_ID**: Joins the `Project` and `Employee` tables based on employee ID to link each employee with their corresponding project.
2. **ROUND(AVG(E.EXPERIENCE_YEARS), 2)**: Calculates the average years of experience for each project and rounds it to two decimal places.
3. **GROUP BY P.PROJECT_ID**: Groups the results by project ID to calculate the average experience for each project.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the `Project` table and m is the number of rows in the `Employee` table. The complexity arises from the join and grouping operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique projects.

## Key Concepts
- SQL JOIN statement
- Calculating averages
- Grouping results with GROUP BY clause

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Project` and `Employee` tables are populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
