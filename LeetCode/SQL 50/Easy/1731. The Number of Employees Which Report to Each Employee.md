# The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the number of direct reports for each employee, along with their name, and the average age of the employees reporting to them. The query should return the employee ID, the employee's name, the count of employees reporting to that employee, and the average age of those employees.

The `Employees` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| age           | int     |
| reports_to    | int     |

```sql
SELECT
    E.employee_id,
    E.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT M.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(M.age), 0) AS average_age
FROM 
    Employees E
LEFT JOIN Employees M ON E.employee_id = M.reports_to
GROUP BY 
    E.employee_id
HAVING 
    reports_count != 0;
```

## Explanation
1. **LEFT JOIN Employees M ON E.employee_id = M.reports_to**: Performs a left join to match each employee (E) with the employees reporting to them (M).
2. **COUNT(DISTINCT M.employee_id) AS reports_count**: Counts the number of distinct employees reporting to each employee.
3. **ROUND(AVG(M.age), 0) AS average_age**: Calculates the average age of the employees reporting to each manager and rounds it to the nearest integer.
4. **HAVING reports_count != 0**: Filters out employees who do not have any direct reports.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employees` table. The complexity arises from the join, grouping, and aggregation operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of unique employee IDs with direct reports.

## Key Concepts
- LEFT JOIN to include employees with no direct reports
- GROUP BY clause to group by employee ID
- Aggregation with COUNT() and AVG() to calculate direct reports and their average age

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Employees` table is populated with relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
