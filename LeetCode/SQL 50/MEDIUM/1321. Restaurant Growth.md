# Restaurant Growth

## Problem Statement
Given a `Customer` table that contains information about the daily revenue collected at a restaurant, write a SQL query to calculate the 7-day moving sum and 7-day moving average of daily revenue. This moving calculation should only start once there are at least 7 days of data. Round the moving average to two decimal places.

## Table Structure

### Customer Table
| Column Name | Type    | Description                           |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| visited_on  | date    | Date when revenue was recorded       |
| amount      | int     | Revenue collected on `visited_on` date |

- `visited_on`: Represents the date of revenue recording.
- `amount`: Represents the revenue amount collected on that specific date.

## Example Input

**Customer Table**
| visited_on | amount |
|------------|--------|
| 2023-01-01 | 100    |
| 2023-01-02 | 120    |
| 2023-01-03 | 130    |
| 2023-01-04 | 150    |
| 2023-01-05 | 160    |
| 2023-01-06 | 140    |
| 2023-01-07 | 180    |
| 2023-01-08 | 200    |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The table contains daily revenue data for a restaurant.
- We are to calculate the 7-day moving sum and moving average, starting from the 7th day onward.

## Expected Output

| visited_on | amount | average_amount |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2023-01-07 | 1080   | 154.29         |
| 2023-01-08 | 1180   | 168.57         |

### Explanation of Output
- **Moving Sum**: The 7-day sum of `amount` values up to each date starting from the 7th record.
- **Moving Average**: The average of these 7-day sums, rounded to two decimal places.

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        visited_on,
        SUM(amount) AS amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY visited_on) AS rw
    FROM
        CUSTOMER
    GROUP BY 
        visited_on
    ORDER BY 
        visited_on
)
SELECT 
    visited_on, 
    moving_sum AS amount, 
    moving_average AS average_amount
FROM (
    SELECT 
        rw,
        visited_on, 
        SUM(amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY visited_on 
            ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS moving_sum,
        ROUND(AVG(amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY visited_on 
            ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ), 2) AS moving_average
    FROM 
        CTE
) AS final
WHERE 
    rw >= 7;

```


## Solution Outline

1. **Define a Common Table Expression (CTE)**:
   - Group daily revenue by `visited_on` and calculate `amount` for each date. Use `ROW_NUMBER` to help with later filtering.

2. **Calculate Moving Sum and Moving Average**:
   - Use window functions to calculate the 7-day moving sum and moving average for `amount`.
   - Only include rows where there are at least 7 days of data.

3. **Filter Rows for Moving Window**:
   - Apply filtering in the final output to ensure the results start from the 7th day.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table, as each row's 7-day window must be processed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), storing each day’s data with its moving sum and average.

## Key Concepts
- **Window Functions**: Using `SUM` and `AVG` with `ROWS BETWEEN` to calculate moving statistics.
- **Date Aggregation**: Grouping by date to ensure each date’s revenue is summed and averaged correctly.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes dates in `Customer` are in consecutive order. If there are gaps, the query might need additional handling.
- Rounding ensures consistent formatting for average values.
