# Patients With a Condition

## Problem Statement
Given a table `Patients` that contains information about patients and their conditions, write a SQL query to retrieve the IDs of patients who have a specific condition. Only select patients whose condition description includes the specified keyword "DIAB1" (case-insensitive).

## Table Structure
**Patients** table:
| Column Name    | Type    | Description                          |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| patient_id     | int     | Unique identifier for each patient   |
| patient_name   | varchar | Name of the patient                  |
| conditions     | varchar | Description of the patient's condition|

- `patient_id`: Represents the unique ID of each patient.
- `patient_name`: Represents the name of the patient.
- `conditions`: Represents a description of the patient's condition, which may contain multiple conditions as a text string.

## Example Input

**Patients** table:
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions                    |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1          | "Alice"      | "DIAB1, HYPERTENSION"         |
| 2          | "Bob"        | "HYPERTENSION"                |
| 3          | "Charlie"    | "DIAB1"                       |
| 4          | "David"      | "ASTHMA, DIAB1"               |

### Explanation of Input Data
- The `conditions` column contains descriptions of medical conditions, where each patientâ€™s condition descriptions may vary in format or contain multiple conditions.

## Expected Output

| patient_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |
| 4          |

```sql
SELECT
    PATIENT_ID,
    PATIENT_NAME,
    CONDITIONS
FROM
    PATIENTS
WHERE   
    (CONDITIONS LIKE 'DIAB1%' OR CONDITIONS LIKE '% DIAB1%')
```
### Explanation of Output
- Only patients who have the condition "DIAB1" in their `conditions` column are selected. This includes patients with conditions containing "DIAB1" alone or in combination with other conditions.

## Solution Outline

1. **Filter by Condition**:
   - Use the `LIKE` operator to search for the keyword "DIAB1" in the `conditions` column.
   - Use `%DIAB1%` with `LIKE` to perform a case-insensitive search and match any occurrence of "DIAB1" within the `conditions` text.

2. **Case-Insensitive Matching**:
   - Depending on the SQL environment, use `ILIKE` (in PostgreSQL) or `LOWER(conditions) LIKE '%diab1%'` to ensure the search is case-insensitive.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Patients` table, as each row needs to be checked for the condition.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of patients that meet the condition.

## Key Concepts
- **Pattern Matching with LIKE**: Using `LIKE` with `%` wildcards to search for substrings within text.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Ensuring the search is case-insensitive so all variations of "DIAB1" (e.g., "diab1", "DIAB1") are matched.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes that the `conditions` column contains a comma-separated list of conditions or free-text descriptions.
- Depending on the database, alternative functions like `ILIKE` or `LOWER()` may be needed for case-insensitive search.
