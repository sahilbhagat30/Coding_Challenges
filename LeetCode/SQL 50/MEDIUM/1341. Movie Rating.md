# Movie Rating

## Problem Statement
Given three tables—`Movies`, `Users`, and `MovieRating`—write a SQL query to:
1. Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
2. Find the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie title.

## Table Structures

### Movies Table
| Column Name | Type    | Description                    |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| movie_id    | int     | Unique identifier for each movie (primary key) |
| title       | varchar | Title of the movie            |

### Users Table
| Column Name | Type    | Description                    |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| user_id     | int     | Unique identifier for each user (primary key) |
| name        | varchar | Name of the user (unique)     |

### MovieRating Table
| Column Name | Type    | Description                               |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| movie_id    | int     | Foreign key referencing `Movies.movie_id` |
| user_id     | int     | Foreign key referencing `Users.user_id`   |
| rating      | int     | Rating given by the user to the movie     |
| created_at  | date    | Date the rating was created               |

- `movie_id`, `user_id` in `MovieRating` together form the primary key.

## Example Input

**Movies Table**
| movie_id | title    |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | Avengers |
| 2        | Frozen 2 |
| 3        | Joker    |

**Users Table**
| user_id | name     |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | Daniel   |
| 2       | Monica   |
| 3       | Maria    |
| 4       | James    |

**MovieRating Table**
| movie_id | user_id | rating | created_at  |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1        | 1       | 3      | 2020-01-12  |
| 1        | 2       | 4      | 2020-02-11  |
| 1        | 3       | 2      | 2020-02-12  |
| 2        | 1       | 5      | 2020-02-17  |
| 2        | 2       | 2      | 2020-02-01  |
| 3        | 1       | 3      | 2020-02-22  |
| 3        | 2       | 4      | 2020-02-25  |

### Expected Output

| results    |
|------------|
| Daniel     |
| Frozen 2   |

### Explanation
- **Top User**: Both Daniel and Monica rated 3 movies, but Daniel is lexicographically smaller.
- **Top Movie in February 2020**: Frozen 2 and Joker have an average rating of 3.5 in February, but Frozen 2 is lexicographically smaller.

```sql
(
    SELECT 
        u.name AS results
    FROM 
        users u
    JOIN 
        MovieRating mr ON u.user_id = mr.user_id
    GROUP BY 
        u.user_id
    ORDER BY 
        COUNT(mr.movie_id) DESC, u.name
    LIMIT 1
)

UNION ALL

(
    SELECT 
        m.title AS results
    FROM 
        Movies m
    JOIN 
        MovieRating mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
    WHERE 
        DATE_FORMAT(mr.created_at, '%Y-%m') = '2020-02'
    GROUP BY 
        m.movie_id
    ORDER BY 
        AVG(mr.rating) DESC, m.title
    LIMIT 1
);
```

## Solution Outline

1. **Finding the Top User**:
   - Join `Users` with `MovieRating` and group by `user_id`.
   - Count the number of movies each user has rated.
   - Order by the count in descending order and by `name` lexicographically.
   - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the user with the highest count and smallest name in case of a tie.

2. **Finding the Top Movie in February 2020**:
   - Join `Movies` with `MovieRating` and filter by the date range `2020-02`.
   - Group by `movie_id` and calculate the average rating for each movie.
   - Order by the average rating in descending order and by `title` lexicographically.
   - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the movie with the highest average rating and smallest title in case of a tie.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting within each subquery.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the result set.

## Key Concepts
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Using `GROUP BY` to count ratings and calculate averages.
- **Lexicographical Ordering**: Ordering by `name` and `title` to handle ties.
- **UNION ALL**: Combining results from two different queries.

## Additional Notes
- This solution assumes the use of MySQL syntax (`DATE_FORMAT` for date filtering).
- The query returns a single table with two rows, one for the top user and one for the top movie in February 2020.
