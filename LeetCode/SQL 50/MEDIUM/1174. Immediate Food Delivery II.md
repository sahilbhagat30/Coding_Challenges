# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The `Delivery` table has the following structure:

| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

- `delivery_id` is the column of unique values of this table.
- The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders on a specific date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
- If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
- The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

## Example Input
Delivery table:

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |

## Example Output
| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 50.00                |

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM 
    Delivery d
WHERE 
    d.delivery_id IN (
        SELECT MIN(delivery_id)
        FROM Delivery
        GROUP BY customer_id
    );
```
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        customer_pref_delivery_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rnk
    FROM 
        Delivery
) AS temp
WHERE 
    rnk = 1;
```

### Explanation
- The customer with ID 1 has a first order with delivery ID 1, and it is scheduled.
- The customer with ID 2 has a first order with delivery ID 2, and it is immediate.
- The customer with ID 3 has a first order with delivery ID 5, and it is scheduled.
- The customer with ID 4 has a first order with delivery ID 7, and it is immediate.
- Hence, half of the customers have immediate first orders.
