# Customer Who Visited But Did Not Make Any Transactions

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the customers who visited but did not make any transactions. You need to return the customer ID and the count of visits for each customer who meets this criterion.

The `VISITS` table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |

The `Transactions` table has the following structure:

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |

- The `visit_id` column in the `Transactions` table corresponds to the `visit_id` column in the `VISITS` table.
- You need to return the `customer_id` and the count of visits for each customer who visited but did not make any transactions.

## Example Input
**VISITS Table:**

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 1           |
| 2        | 1           |
| 3        | 2           |
| 4        | 3           |
| 5        | 3           |

**Transactions Table:**

| transaction_id | visit_id |
|----------------|----------|
| 1              | 1        |
| 2              | 2        |

## Example Output
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 2           | 1              |
| 3           | 2              |

```sql
SELECT
    V. customer_id,
    COUNT( V. customer_id) count_no_trans
FROM
    VISITS V
LEFT JOIN 
    Transactions T
    ON T.visit_id = V.visit_id 
WHERE 
    T.TRANSACTION_ID IS NULL
GROUP BY 
    V. customer_id
```

## Explanation
- The query should return the customer ID and the count of visits for customers who visited but did not make any transactions. In this example, customer 2 visited once without making a transaction, and customer 3 visited twice without making any transactions.
