# Big Countries

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the names, populations, and areas of countries that are either large in area or have a large population. 

The `world` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| name          | varchar |
| population    | int     |
| area          | int     |

- A country is considered "big" if it meets at least one of the following criteria:
  - The area of the country is greater than or equal to 3,000,000 square kilometers.
  - The population of the country is greater than or equal to 25,000,000 people.

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    population,
    area
FROM
    world
WHERE
    area>=3000000 
    OR population >= 25000000
```

## Explanation
1. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects the `name`, `population`, and `area` from the `world` table.
2. **WHERE Clause**: The condition filters the results to include countries that either have an area of at least 3,000,000 or a population of at least 25,000,000.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `world` table. The query scans through the table to find matching rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of matching countries.

## Key Concepts
- SQL SELECT statement
- Filtering results with WHERE clause
- Understanding logical operators (AND, OR)

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `world` table is populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
