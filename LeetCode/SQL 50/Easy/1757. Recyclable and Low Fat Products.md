# Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with writing a SQL query to find the product IDs of all products that are both low fat and recyclable. 

The `Products` table has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
| low_fats      | varchar |
| recyclable     | varchar |

- `low_fats` is 'Y' if the product is low fat and 'N' otherwise.
- `recyclable` is 'Y' if the product is recyclable and 'N' otherwise.

```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

## Explanation
1. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects the `product_id` from the `Products` table.
2. **WHERE Clause**: It filters the results to include only those products where `low_fats` is 'Y' and `recyclable` is 'Y'.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Products` table. The query scans through the table to find matching rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the query itself, but the result set will depend on the number of matching products.

## Key Concepts
- SQL SELECT statement
- Filtering results with WHERE clause
- Understanding data types in SQL

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `Products` table is populated with the relevant data to test the query.
- This query can be executed in any SQL environment that supports standard SQL syntax.
